The codes in this file perform the architecture level simulation for neural ASICs. We have a simulator for our proposed NeuroSynth and also a simulator for DianNao structure. 
The simulators forcuses on simulating the latency (including compute and memory) and the usage of cache and compute units with different tiling and reuse parameters of the neural networks.
